left: start of the sliding window.

right: end of the sliding window (iterator).

max_len: stores the maximum length found.
Move the windowâ€™s left boundary only when a repeat is detected. Store where each character was last seen so you can skip to just after its last appearance."Time: O(n) (each character visited once)
